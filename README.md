# FlatStyleBusiness
PSD to HTML training

**FlatStyleBusiness** - it's a training layout where I honed layout skills. A long time ago i finished this layout, but over time, 
I realized that my skills grew. So I decided to refactor this layout from scratch and add a lot of features. 

**Implemented features**:
+ Adaptive design;
+ Lazy load;
+ Images preload;
+ JavaScript Media Queries;
